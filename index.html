                <h3><a name="the-core-concepts"></a>The core concepts</h3>
                <p>There are some concepts being crucial for the entire narrative.</p>
                <p>The first one includes energy, intellect and mind. It defines who HS is in whole and as a certain person
                    particularly.
                </p>
                <p>The second references to political power, political system and ideology. These, in turn, define what is the
                    society.
                </p>
                <p>And there is another immensely important factor &mdash; the scientific and technological progress. An interaction
                    of all these three things defines what the civilization is and what is going to happen to it.</p>
                <p>There is nothing new and too exciting here so far of course. But what is presumably is really interesting
                    the new way of thinking of the source of so-called human nature and how it shapes the society itself.
                    Nowadays, however, an opposite standpoint is widely propagated, that society forms human mindset. No
                    doubt, it does, but only to some extent, not totally. And this misconception impedes many intellectuals
                    to realize, why the modern society is not what humanists and liberals desire it to be, and never will.
                    It explains why authoritarian leaders like Trump, Putin, Erdogan are as successful as their forerunners
                    like Hitler or Stalin. By other words &mdash; why history is failed to be a good teacher for people.</p>
                <p>And without understanding a true nature of HS species as not only a social, but a biological unit not in
                    last turn, we are in danger never enter the future, which a huge part of our book is dedicated to as
                    well. Instead of this, we are going to be doomed to go endlessly and grievously on closed circle when
                    social progress suddenly ceased, crushing civilization and precipitate humanity into a new barbaric epoch.</p>
                <h3><a name="homo-sapiens-decomposed"></a>Homo Sapiens decomposed</h3>
                <h4>Born with legacy</h4>
                <p>There a concept of different segments of Homo Sapiens within the same species is established. We define them
                    as:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="#_Homo_Sapiens_Re-active">Homo Sapiens Re-active, HS(r)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#_Homo_Sapiens_Thinking">Homo Sapiens Thinking, HS(t)</a> and</li>
                    <li><a href="#_Homo_Sapiens_Stirring">Homo Sapiens Stirring, HS(s)</a></li>
                </ol>
                <p>In our classification, at the certain point we refer to the popular concept named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck">The Spiral Dynamics</a>.
                    But we go further, claiming that there are genetically predefined mental features for people which define
                    the last stage an individual is able to reach.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Looking ahead, it is necessary to point out, that we strongly claim to exclude all kind of discrimination
                        towards any person whatever his/her innate features and predispositions would be. This should be
                        proclaimed absolutely clear. Moreover, further, we are going to consider how it is possible for people
                        to have a meaningful (or happy if you prefer this term) life, despite all the differences of dignity
                        and mental capacities which they have. Particularly there is intended to be a part devoted to the
                        Human Enhancement subject, which becomes more and more important as society is affected by the accelerating
                        pace of technical progress.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The idea is that their perception of reality and, consequently, behavior is defined by specific for a certain
                    category so-called a discrete <strong>mentally-behavioral pattern</strong> (MBP). Put it simply, human,
                    belonging to one category, never does some things which may be done by human from other one as their
                    MBPs don&rsquo;t intersect. Those MBPs, metaphorically speaking, ran in the parallel isolated containers.</p>
                <p>For example, consider an extreme situation when people find themselves beyond any civilized social rules
                    and constrains, oppressing their primordial instincts. It may be some natural disaster, war, imprisonment
                    and so forth. It is well known that individuals divide instantly and spontaneously into two major groups,
                    members of which conduct accordingly to the absolutely different behavioral models.</p>
                <p>The first one implements the exact scenario innate to the primordial society of hunter-gatherers with all
                    its attributes. The main force for that group is the brutal violence, rigid hierarchy of power and considering
                    all other groups as rivals for resources and thereby enemies.</p>
                <p>The second one contains members, denying such rules. They tend to support each other and their community
                    relays on some moral imperatives. Although this doesn&rsquo;t mean that there are no any authorities
                    at all. But the crucial difference is that there is a proclivity to take into account interests of all
                    members, including those who is weak and vulnerable. Empathy, unlikely the first group, plays role here.</p>
                <p>Notice, that we consider the situation when the environment is the same for all those people. So why they
                    conduct so differently? Because of their MBPs. They are genetically predefined. That means that someone
                    will never become a looter, a murderer or a rapist, but someone unavoidably will under certain circumstances.
                    This explains an immense amount of atrocities in situations mentioned above. When there is no restraining
                    fear of the punishment, the real nature of such brutish human being appears.</p>
                <p>And there is an explicit evolutionary reason for that, regarding us as a species. In fact, all the peculiarities
                    in human nature have meaning as an inner variety is very important for species for their sustainability.
                    The environment may change faster than species can evolve, so marginal specimen suddenly may fit new
                    external requirements better than stable majority. And this outlines some biological framework which
                    defines sets of mentally-behavioral features for the entire species for survival. Such idea is expressed
                    in the discipline developed by E. O. Wilson named &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociobiology">Sociobiology</a>&rdquo;.
                    This convergent scientific approach argues that living creatures have some evolutionary predefined behavioral
                    patterns produced by natural selection which facilitates them to survive by the most effective way. It
                    is very important to notice, that those patterns are different for species in whole and for a species
                    unit. If, for some reason, they contradict to each other, then the species needs have priority. It sheds
                    light on such peculiar apparitions in the nature like altruism and self-sacrificing. Put it simply, we
                    often conduct unexpectedly to ourselves.</p>
                <p>The idea about some predefined faculties which may overcome social demands is still considered as controversial
                    by many modern intellectuals and even as heretical one. Especially if it regards not to obvious features
                    like physical conditions but to moral ones. It is still widely assumed, accordingly to notorious the
                    &ldquo;tabula rasa&rdquo; concept, that human being are born without any ethics at all and it is society
                    which forms their beliefs and makes them morally responsible. It is well known how much suffering humanity
                    endured due to such the utopic idea. The bloodiest ideology, communism, claimed to create a &ldquo;new
                    human&rdquo; instead of just human and this has led to dozens of millions being killed, imprisoned and
                    humiliated.
                </p>
                <p>Actually, we don&rsquo;t claim that someone is born fully fledged, either being a villain or a man of virtue.
                    Moral imperatives are subject of human experience as well, but only to some extent. So again &mdash;
                    someone will never do some things which someone other will. Hitler will never be Socrates and vice versa.
                    First one was born not Hitler, of course, but with a set of features which led him <em>to become</em>                    Hitler <em>under certain circumstances</em>. The same about second one.</p>
                <p>It appears from very childhood and pedagogues are aware of that very well. We know that children may differ
                    much regarding their behavioral models from ethical point of view. Some of them like torturing animals
                    or destroying what other children build. Moreover, evidently it may give them pleasure.</p>
                <p>Let me repeat that we are considering biological predefinitions of diverse types of HS, but not any responsibility
                    of them. The human being cannot bear any responsibility due to its nature or certain set of features.
                    He/she is responsible only for acting and subsequences, but this is an absolutely different question.</p>
                <p>In general terms, visible outcomes of different MBPs on the individual scale are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The threshold of abstinence from violence</li>
                    <li>The exposure to propaganda</li>
                    <li>Ability to control emotionally driven behaviors</li>
                    <li>Capacity for strategic altruism</li>
                    <li>Predisposition to cooperation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Evidently those faculties greatly impact an individual behavior and all together with cultural norms applied
                    to the particular society, defines what it is, what it is going to be and what it cannot be. We argue
                    that not only MBPs are predefined, but ratio of segments within HS species is the same among all races
                    and ethnicities across the globe. Our classification has nothing in common with any external differences
                    of people and/or their societies (but the communities are absolutely another thing!). No matter if a
                    particular human being is a man or a woman, white, black or Asian, which land he/she was born in etc.</p>
                <p>So here is a brief description of 3 types of HS and how they refer to faculties established in The Spiral
                    Dynamics:
                </p>
                <h4>Homo Sapiens Re-active</h4>
                <p>Level: between beige and blue.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A representative with the lowest mind/instincts ratio, since he in fact does not possess the mind at
                        all, as , except for rare glimpses that appear as a result of an extreme situation.</li>
                    <li>A typical representative of the so-called. "Masses". Absolutely self-centered. Serves as the main source
                        of energy for the needs of the political process. Used by elites as an expendable material during
                        revolutions and wars. Easily lends itself to propaganda.</li>
                    <li>Has a low intelligence; mind, as noted above, is in a rudimentary, embryonic state or completely absent.</li>
                    <li>Behavior is mostly automatic, impulsive, that is, it is ahead of the stage of intellectual analysis,
                        which in many cases is completely absent.</li>
                    <li>In the assessments of others, he is guided by the principle of generalization, instinctively referring
                        them to some hostile (more often) or friendly (less often) group.</li>
                    <li>Does not feel the need to explore the surrounding world, the only motive of behavior are instinctive
                        mechanisms, such as the need for resources to sustain life, reproduction, the desire for self-preservation
                        and pleasure. He experiences disbelief, turning into disgust and hatred for everything that he cannot
                        comprehend.
                    </li>
                    <li>Believes in conspiracy theory.</li>
                    <li>Immediately becomes part of the mob when the corresponding trigger is running and acts fully within the
                        standard scenario of its behavior.</li>
                    <li>In the absence of external restraints, such as the repressive apparatus of the community, he automatically
                        switches to the mode of primitive behavior with violence as a tool for problem solving by default.
                        He is an active participant in crimes committed during armed conflicts. It also automatically participates
                        in the persecution of other individuals, in the absence of external intervention &mdash; even to
                        the point of death, if the bait was initiated by someone from his group.</li>
                    <li>In the zone of natural disasters invariably gets into flocks operating as autonomous groups, repeating
                        the mode of action of hunter-gatherers, i.e., becomes a member of gangs of marauders, robbers, rapists
                        and murderers. Similarly behaves in places of imprisonment, quickly occupying a cell in the corresponding
                        niche of a rigid hierarchy of power and completely obeying its laws.</li>
                    <li>In any team, it also automatically obeys "authority", which is quickly recognized intuitively. In the
                        presence of individuals with a lower rank than he, behaves as an authority, according to the same
                        standard scenario.</li>

                    <li>Has no idea of ​​the meaning of the term "environment". In the absence of a limiting external influence,
                        he litters the place of its habitat with waste of vital activity until the onset of an ecological
                        catastrophe, which he does not perceive because is unable to connect such a result with his own actions.</li>
                    <li>The world outlook fully fits into the description given to the person by T. Hobbes. No voluntary long-term
                        productive activity is able, the work is regarded as forced evil in the name of obtaining a livelihood.</li>
                    <li>Is able to change the pattern of his behavior only as a result (and only for a while) of external influence,
                        the only acting type of which is one form of violence or another.</li>
                    <li>It is also incapable of any planning beyond the basic needs of the organism mentioned above and cooperation
                        that requires creative thinking, since this ability is in the most primitive state due to a lack
                        of personal motivation for its development.</li>
                    <li>Has no idea about altruism.</li>
                    <li>Art is insensitive, except for its most primitive, mass forms, directly affecting the same centers of
                        basic sensations.</li>
                    <li>He has a vague idea of ​​the concept of the past and the future, he lives "here and now."</li>

                <h4>Homo Sapiens Thinking</h4>
                <p>The ratio of the levels is shifted towards the coral one.</p>

                    <li>Occasionally may participate in state activities, but he never sees power as a personal priority and

                </ul>
                <h4>Homo Sapiens Stirring</h4>
                <p>This segment is an intermediate layer between the two antipodes considered above. The most controversial
                    and heterogeneous category, with the maximum "intraspecific" spread of parameters. Nevertheless, all
                    members of the group share the same characteristic: the possession of both intellect and reason, albeit
                    in very varying limits. However, unlike HS (t), the reason is not an unconditional dominant over the
                    remaining components of HS (s) consciousness.</p>
                <p>Reaches a green level in The Spiral Dynamics.</p>
                <p>It is important to make one very important observation: this segment can be conditionally divided into 2
                    other sub-segments, and this division is structurally similar to the hierarchy of the classical structure
                    of society: the elite and the masses. We respectively call the first Homo Sapiens stirring <em>up</em>,
                    while the second one &mdash; Homo Sapiens stirring <em>down</em>. Between the first and second ones there
                    are numerous transitional options, and it is almost impossible to draw a line between neighboring those.</p>
                <h5>HS(s,u)</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The attitude to own "ego" is: a different degree of egocentricity, a high degree of selfishness.</li>
                    <li>The major type of activity is mental.</li>
                    <li>He has a high intellect, including &mdash; often &mdash; emotional one. Is capable to feel the mood of
                        people subtly, and to abstract from one's own emotions.</li>
                    <li>Unmistakably identifies propaganda and can act as its generator. Has a sophistical and/or demagogic talent,
                        developed intuition and a quick mind.</li>
                    <li>Has ability to develop original ideas, including political ones.</li>
                    <li>Can be a representative of authority, up to the highest level of the hierarchy. Possessing it is often
                        the main life priority, up to the obsession.</li>
                    <li>As a rule, does not experience sensual pleasure from the use of violence, if faced with such a need.
                        Being endowed with power, he prefers to act by the hands of others and treats this as a normal tool
                        for achieving goals. Nevertheless, he has a developed sense of empathy, as a rule, reliably controlled
                        by his intellect.</li>
                    <li>Is a mankind supplier of a multitude of both outstanding technocrats and bright thinkers-humanitarians,
                        especially philosophers, talented artists, among whom there are real geniuses, as well as politicians,
                        including authoritarian &mdash; usurpers of power, dictators, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>HS(s,d)</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>An attitude to own "ego" is: different degrees of selfishness, a high degree of self-centeredness.</li>
                    <li>Has a different degree of intelligence &mdash; from medium to high.</li>
                    <li>Is more or less susceptible to propaganda, and is not always able to identify its impact on oneself.</li>
                    <li>Exposed to the herd instinct in much the same way as HS (r).</li>
                    <li>Can be a representative of the government apparatus, as well as one of the components of its ecosystem:
                        media, university, public organization, etc.</li>
                    <li>Under certain circumstances, is capable of using violence, in many cases experiencing pleasure and having
                        a tendency to guide the actions of HS (r).</li>
                    <li>Can adhere to the widest range of political and moral and ethical beliefs, sometimes subject to evolution,
                        up to a complete change in the vector.</li>
                    <li>May be both an idealist and a cynic. It can also be a supplier of technocrats, humanitarians and artists,
                        including outstanding ones.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some common characteristics for HS (s, u) and HS (s, d) are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The attitude to religion varies very widely &mdash; from atheism to sincere faith.</li>
                    <li>They use lies/manipulation to achieve their goals, but they are able to realize the immorality of such
                        an act and their responsibility for it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If we agree with such view upon the indivisible from biological perspective HS species, this will allow us
                    to make extremely valuable inferences about our society, its past, present and a presumable future.</p>
                <h3><a name="hs-and-civilization"></a>HS and Civilization</h3>
                <p>Our classification assists to understand the essence of the most valuable problems that our society is faced
                    on the global scale and how we could cope with them. Both the basic functional structure of any society
                    and its driving forces as well, remain the same throughout the whole history of mankind. And this undoubtedly
                    corresponds to the internal structure of HS as a species, although it is not a precise reflection of
                    it yet.</p>
                <p>It is established as a pyramid consisting of 3 layers. The basic one is masses, passively holding biological
                    vigor, which they are unable to manage for any &mdash; more or less &mdash; sophisticated activity for
                    sake of themselves, but which may be spontaneously released and cause of damage on social order. That
                    what happens while revolutions, riots and natural disasters. In words of one syllable, they are a source
                    of the primordial energy which we inherited from the animal kingdom. Further, we will use to call this
                    the &ldquo;relic energy of masses&rdquo; (REM).</p>
                <p>On the top of the pyramid, the elites reside. Those individuals possess a higher intellect, willing, and
                    ambitions. As a rule, they are obsessed by obtaining the power. They are able to extract REM, coagulate
                    it and use in name of getting power. And this often reshapes the society.</p>
                <p>And between them, a middle tier lays &mdash; the functional apparatus. Its representatives possess intelligence,
                    but not so bright as elites have. Also, they have no such great and focused on the power, willing. As
                    a result, they are constrained to serve to elites as a tool to manage masses.</p>
                <p>So the masses are HS(r) and partially &mdash; HS(s,d). The apparatus is HS(s,d) and HS(s,u), the elite is
                    HS(s,u). Inasmuch it is about power, we don&rsquo;t place HS(t) into this specific image. That kind of
                    individuals keeps them aside of a direct political power as their mindset is different. They are driven
                    by a classical philosophical representation of reality, considering the world of human beings through
                    such absolutistic categories as &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;evil&rdquo;, revealing a metaphysical (or,
                    if you wish, a cosmological one) phenomenon, albeit some of them may do that even unconsciously. As a
                    matter of fact, it is nothing else, but their ideas and/or deeds change the essence of society, although
                    it may take centuries before they conquer up human minds (Socrates or Jesus would be perfect examples
                    of such kind of people). So, they don&rsquo;t want a political power, they desire an idea about a
                    <u>bsolute truth </u>
                    <u>t</u>o took over the people.</p>
                <p>But the point is that
                    <u>only elites, being highly intellectually developed, are capable to grasp the meaning of those ideas and
                        realize the necessity of them to be applied for society.</u> Masses cannot really understand anything
                    beyond their biologically predefined, limited sensations. But because elites, obtaining power, need the
                    vigor of masses, like a rocket requires an enormous amount of fuel to get into space, they always used
                    to expose ideas produced by HS(t) in simplified version. This kind of idea is adapted to the masses mindset,
                    persuading them that they are going to obtain something really important, even to such extent, that it
                    deserves to sacrifice their lives. This took place in all the times, from the very appearance of civilization.
                    That is the purpose of the ideology which a big part of the book is dedicated to also.</p>
                <h3><a nae="what-went-wrong"></a>What went wrong?</h3>
                <p>But what&rsquo;s the problem indeed? Is it really anything went wrong with a modern liberal society or everything
                    is perfect?</p>
                <p>We consider that something is quite terribly out of the tune.</p>
                <p>The point is that the modern society seems has no idea which explains to people what to live for. And this
                    takes place for the first time since the civilization was established on the surface of our planet.</p>
                <p>It is a crucial humans&rsquo; need to have some reason of existence which make them freed of terror of upcoming
                    nothingness. It always been a mission of religion, such as Christianity, Islam or Buddhism. The human
                    mind just cannot apply idea of its own termination. And after religious beliefs kept shrinking, the ideology
                    took the holy place. Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t promise human to live forever, but at least it implies a
                    great relief in form of some consolation perceived indirectly.</p>
                <p>But currently a political establishment proposes nothing to fill the gap in human minds between physical
                    existence and death<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. Instead, there is an endless flow of chattering
                    about &ldquo;rights&rdquo;. In particular, those are rights in respect of various groups, to which society
                    was divided by a modern socio-political view of reality. Those group include, some to mention, LGBT,
                    racial, ethnical and religious minorities, women, so-called &ldquo;native people&rdquo; and so forth.
                    Not surprisingly that people who don&rsquo;t seek themselves among representatives of those groups feel
                    abandoned and alienated from their own society. As a result, leaders considered before as marginals as
                    they constantly used to deny so-called liberal/democratic values, begin to increase the political influence
                    and social weight. The election of D. Trump has appeared as a smacking slap into the face to not only
                    American, but to the world-wide liberal political establishment and even elites beyond it.</p>
                <p>But despite feverish attempts to scrutinize what was happening, the elites seem have failed to understand
                    the underlying essence of the phenomenon again. There are lots of buzz about &ldquo;mental wrongness&rdquo;
                    of Trump&rsquo;s supporters, malicious media, Russian intervention into election, spreading of &ldquo;anti-intellectualism&rdquo;
                    and so on, the endless list of nonsense, which enumerates consequences, but not the cause. And as a result,
                    the proposing recipes are the same &mdash; to educate people, to explain them the values of democracy
                    and all terrible harm, which leaders who deny such values, may expose upon society. So, they just completely
                    have missed the point and it looks like they are doomed to repeat this over and over again. The idea
                    consolidating the society had disappeared, and nothing came instead.</p>
                <p>And since modern liberal elites don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on, they expose not too much concern
                    about the absence of such idea. Because of belief in constant and inevitable social progress being established
                    during decades passed after WW-II. Then as long as there is no any substitution to Christianity or even
                    to the national idea, calling citizens to unite for some virtuous purpose, then inner forces in society,
                    originated directly from REM, turn against it. Thus, the society like an organism suffering of autoimmune
                    disease, runs the process of self-destructing. One of obvious apparitions of this process is cultural
                    shift in social perception of reality and, particularly, morality of politics. As interests of groups
                    get higher priority, they unavoidably start to compete for the resources allocated across society. This,
                    in turn, makes every group more and more ideologically engaged, and now the poison of ideology is directed
                    not outside country and even not against some minority within society, but it intoxicates the entire
                    society itself, leading to the state of <em>bellum omnium contra omnes</em>. This gradually begins to
                    be perceived as a &ldquo;new normality&rdquo; and this is the way which civilization is agonizing unnoticeably
                    and moves towards barbarism.</p>
                <h3><a name="is-this-fixable"></a>Is this fixable?</h3>
                <p>The first step to resolve the problem is to understand its roots.</p>
                <p>There is a belief in modern society that people, even if they are different to some extend are able successfully
                    cooperate with each other if the society itself provides a necessary set of tools to them and will render
                    them highly motivated. This is a huge concept named &ldquo;egalitarianism&rdquo;. And if we took a glance
                    on the modus operandi of elites, they do exactly what that the idea implies: they constantly try to inspire
                    people with liberal values and stimulate them to express that conviction through political activity.
                    Under political activity is assumed to give votes for liberal politicians. Yet in Europe unlikely US,
                    demagogues are didn&rsquo;t reach political Olympus. But nonetheless, they were much more successful
                    than before in many countries. As a matter of fact, in some of them a representative democracy turned
                    into its imitation form. Those countries are Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Turkey. In some other East-European
                    countries similar processes take place.</p>
                <p>People vote not for leaders calling to progress, they do that for those, who is calling <em>against enemies</em>.</p>
                <p>This is an old, as world itself, trick. And as long as it is used, it works.</p>
                <p>Why?</p>
                <p>Because, as we mentioned above, there is no any seminal idea, promoting by elites, which an ordinary human
                    can believe in, but as the holly spot may not be empty, some destructive ideologies come instead.</p>
                <p>Those are the same &mdash; nationalism, xenophobia and religious extremism, particularly &mdash; Islamism.
                    They fairly fit the mind of HS(r) and HS(s,d). And this is going not to be сeased since a major part
                    of people, the biggest segments of HS species, are exist. Because those features are the evolutionary
                    legacy of HS, which we wrote about earlier.</p>
                <p>So, what to do?</p>
                <p>First of all, open your eyes&copy;. We must to re-think HS.</p>
                <p>From biological perspective, all we are the same species. This is good news, because this is why we must
                    totally exclude any discrimination against any human being based on belonginess to one or another segment.</p>
                <p>For clarity, &ldquo;the same species&rdquo;, following biological definition, is capacity of any two specimen
                    of opposite sex, taken randomly, to have progeny without any bad biological consequences. And it is exactly
                    what we have. The brightest genius can mate with most dull individual and there is going no any biological
                    disaster afterwards. Yes, the progeny may appear not by all means genius, it may be, on the contrary,
                    quite dull, but it is not a disaster, it is just a common individual characteristic within the same species.</p>
                <p>But this doesn&rsquo;t mean, that a genius and a dull individual must have the equal access to decision making
                    for all social and/or political issues. It is obvious that a second one is incapable to make a proper
                    decision in the domain where intellectual level of genius is required. There is no any discrimination,
                    it is just a common sense. Discrimination takes place when an individual is deprived to make decision
                    in the domain where his/her competency is enough for that. So, it is not a problem of rights, this is
                    a technical question. A modern society has not to provide the ability to make decisions of all levels
                    of complexity for all individuals despite their real intellectual capacities and/or level of skills.</p>
                <p>Actually, it contradicts not only to the egalitarianism, but to the current democratic tradition, although
                    it doesn&rsquo;t refute the principle of democracy itself. And ironically enough this contradiction in
                    turn contradicts not only to common sense but to the absolutely legitimate approach to estimate mental
                    capacities of young people who attend school. It is a standard practice to divide them into 3 levels
                    by their abilities of studying. And each level corresponds to the further steps of education &mdash;
                    middle professional, middle special and higher education. So, what is considered quite normal for education
                    is denied by political system to be applied to voters.</p>
                <p>The point is that if we can set the system which is capable to give all the people to make the best decisions
                    accordingly their skills for that then we don&rsquo;t need a politics as such. We don&rsquo;t need to
                    persuade people to vote, we don&rsquo;t need to hold parliament because we can exchange the representative
                    democracy with the direct democracy. And it would be a most adequate implementation of democracy as an
                    idea &mdash; a direct participation in the government for everybody who wants to. Some sort of invisible
                    rational machinery instead of the monkey crowd.</p>
                <p>However, the contemporary politicians would be barely happy about this idea because the essence of their
                    existence and only their true passion is possessing of power. This circumstance is crucial. As all we
                    are human being and we agreed that nobody may be an object of discrimination, it is unable to exclude
                    the most ambitious people from social life.</p>
                <p>This implies, in turn, that we have to re-think a structure of society itself. It should fit all the desires
                    and talents of people, whatever they be. Especially if someone is extremely ambitious and vigorous.</p>
                <p>Looks like a little bit utopian? Probably it does. But future will come despite if we want it or not. The
                    only question remaining under our consideration &mdash; do we want it to be better or like a primordial
                    times nightmare?</p>
                <h3><a name="future"></a>Future</h3>
                <p>So, future. We used to think that we build it, but it is a matter of discussion whether we do or it forces
                    us to undertake something in order not to fall into oblivion.</p>
                <p>There was an idea of UBI born. Many people are yet very skeptical about it, giving a lot of reasons why this
                    will never work. However, it seems the exact case when it doesn&rsquo;t matter not only what they think
                    or do, but whether it is going to work. If it is not, then we must do something else in order to establish
                    a new approach just because the old one leads us to disaster anyway.</p>
                <p>So, let&rsquo;s imagine that by somehow it works. What then? We assume that it will affect the society tremendously.
                    It will totally reshape it.</p>
                <p>If you don&rsquo;t need to work, that means you may not to be a member of society. You are freed of all social
                    obligations. You may vote or not, love your country or hate it, be socially involved or ignore the whole
                    world behind your backyard.</p>
                <p>What the politicians can do then if all (or almost all) triggers which they used in order to inflame voter,
                    cease to work?! The basis of politics is to persuade the electorate that there are enemies already near,
                    going to intrude the land, kill all the men and children, rape and enslave all the women and plunder
                    the entire country. And voters have to elect the particular political party to protect them and bestow
                    a salvation to them. But what if there is no need to fight for resources anymore? What if there is &ldquo;plenty
                    of food &amp; sex everywhere&rdquo;? What if we just can&rsquo;t find anything being worth to risk?</p>
                <p>And do you think that this is just another utopian imagery?</p>
                <p>Well, then welcome to the New Unimaginable World, where HS is not the only intelligent creature anymore.</p>
                <h4>Behind the facet</h4>
                <p>And maybe you have noticed that there is already a pre-pre-alpha version of the prototype for that system
                    which we <a href="#machinery">mentioned</a> above. The hefty part of humanity already resides in one
                    place, i.e. &mdash; in FB. And it is very likely that almost all people be there in near future. That
                    implies a total control over them. Yet we mean just their actions and preferences being analyzed by system
                    algorithms for sake of the business. But currently we already have crossed the line of the entirely different
                    reality than we had even some years ago and the last US election has proved that. Now there is extremely
                    powerful tool to influence people&rsquo;s opinion. In fact, system can literally create different versions
                    of reality to display. And as recent events in Russian-Ukrainian conflict have shown it is quite plausible
                    strategy: the people on opposite sides of conflict believed in the totally contradictory pictures. It
                    was because of their media environment, particularly &mdash; TV, which disseminated totally different
                    message in both cases.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Human Enhancement</h4>
                <p>There is such a popular concept. Humans were always obsessed by willing to transcend their natural limitations.
                    And now we approach the mind-blowing point in our history when a millennial dream comes true. The human
                    enhancement tightly tied to and is part of another, broader concept, called Transhumanism.</p>
                <p>There are lots of concerns about so-called &ldquo;intrusion into human nature&rdquo;. Evidently, possessing
                    such powerful technologies which can edit the human genome should be matter of ethical consideration.
                    No doubt, this is a long, complicated and, probably, intricated way to pass. It is impossible to imagine
                    in all details how we could look and feel if we become more than HS as just a biological species. Nevertheless,
                    there is a question which regards directly to our approach, dividing HS into 3 (in fact &mdash; into
                    4) categories accordingly discrete MBPs.</p>
                <p>So, all the people possess REM. And often it causes of damages on individuals and the entire society. There
                    are socially unadapted people include those who tend to expose violence upon other. Currently, the judiciary
                    just isolates them from other members of society by imprisoning. And this is a big problem and always
                    was. In many if not major cases the cause of criminal behavior is rooted from inherited traits. That
                    means that the individual conducted criminal behavior, is tended for relapse, and needs additional efforts
                    to withhold. It is not only hard, this contradicts to the natural psychological make up of that individual.
                    So, he/she is under permanent risk to breach socially acceptable framework of behavior.</p>
                <p>But speaking functionally, it is not necessary the problem of the entire body or mind. Many people having
                    emotional biases can conduct normally except some circumstances which trigger a specific mental mechanism
                    in their brain which leads to trouble. So again, from functional point of view it is necessary to eliminate
                    such piece (most certainly tiny) of personality, but not personality itself. There were lots of observations
                    in medicine when a medication course helped people to change behavior. But this approach hardly to be
                    very reliable not to mention an ethical question as it may have some severe side effects. The Human Enhancement
                    approach implies the precisely targeted changes on the genetical level without affection on any traits
                    which are not intended to touch. And as technology will allow using this approach by efficient way, that
                    would resolve a huge and painful problem.</p>
